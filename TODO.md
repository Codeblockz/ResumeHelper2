## 🎯 Quick Start for New Developers

1. **Environment Setup** (30 mins)
   - Clone repo and run `./scripts/setup.sh`
   - Choose local vs containerized Ollama
   - Verify all services start successfully

2. **First Contribution** (2-4 hours)
   - Pick a backend model (resume.py, job.py, or application.py)
   - Implement the SQLAlchemy model
   - Create basic API endpoint
   - Write simple test

3. **Core Feature Development** (1-2 weeks)
   - Focus on one major service (file processing, AI integration, or frontend component)
   - Implement end-to-end functionality
   - Add comprehensive tests

This TODO list provides a roadmap from MVP to production-ready application. Start with Phase 1 tasks marked as highest priority, then move through the phases systematically.
